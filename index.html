                <p>The program received as input a list of orders that specified whether the trader intended to buy or
                    sell
                    a specific stock. As output, the program would simulate a stock market by printing when a certain
                    stock
                    is bought or sold when it is profitable to do so. I also implemented an algorithm to calculate the
                    ideal
                    time that a time traveler theoretically could have bought shares of a stock and then later sold that
                    stock to maximize profit. Completing this project gave me experience using priority queues and the
                    STL
                    and it helped me become more proficient with object-oriented design.
